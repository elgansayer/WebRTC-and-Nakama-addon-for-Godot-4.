TODO

 - Somehow get (and predict) input on nodes that actually use it, maybe via _get_network_input() and _predict_network_input() methods?
 - Don't store values on input if they are at their default values (smaller input dictionaries to pass over the network)
 - Figure out how to handle rolling animation player forward
   * Maybe set the animation player's process mode to manual and then use .advance() to move it forward?
 - Log the game state from each peer so we can compare it after each run is finished
 - Add some error signal to SyncManager so we can handle catastrophic failures
 - Attempt to use rpc_unreliable() instead of plain rpc() for the tick messages
