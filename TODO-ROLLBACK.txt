TODO
====

 - Fix win detection to work with rollback model (will this fix the position going out of sync?)
 - Implement NetworkFrameTimer node that counts frames rather than time
 - Add some kind of utility for sync'ing AnimationPlayer's? (Could be a script to add to the AnimationPlayer node?)
 - Add debug window (F11?) that shows ping, time, advantage, skipped frames and rollbacks
 - Do some 3-4 player playtests?
 - Dig into possible physics issues with rollback
