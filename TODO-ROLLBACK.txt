TODO
====

 - Add a SyncManager.is_player_input_complete(tick) method
 - Log the game state from each peer so we can compare it after each run is finished
 - Add some error signal to SyncManager so we can handle catastrophic failures
 - Attempt to use rpc_unreliable() instead of plain rpc() for the tick messages
