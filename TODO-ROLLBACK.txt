TODO
====

 - Inject input from remote peer into the input buffer and do rollback if necessary
 - Somehow get (and predict) input on nodes that actually use it, maybe via _get_network_input() and _predict_network_input() methods?
 - Log the game state from each peer so we can compare it after each run is finished
 - Add some error signal to SyncManager so we can handle catastrophic failures
